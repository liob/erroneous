Erroneous allows you to mark all packages of a channel as errata. It allows you to distinguish 
between security and bugfix erratas.


How it works:
1.	Erroneous connects to the spacewalk server through the xmlrpc api and asks the server for a 
	list of all packages in the specified channel(s).
2.	A unique errata name is generated for each packages in the pattern: 
	package:name-package:version.pacakge:release_errataGen
	i.e.: kernel-firmware-2.6.32.131.17.1.el6_errataGen
	The architecture is not included in the errata name. This results in one errata for all archs
	containing packages for all archs.
3.	Erroneous then searches for an existing errata with that name and appends the package to the
	errata, if it exists, or creates a new errata if no errata is found.


HowTo:
Edit the erroneous.conf to match your setup. Then run erroneous.py.

How do I select/delete all auto generated errata?
search for the string "errataGen"
